# Did you know the City of Pasadena already has a [fiber network](https://ww5.cityofpasadena.net/information-technology/fiber-services/)?

** This site's intention is to provide information to Pasadena residents regarding the potential for us to create our own municipal broadband network.**

** Why would we want to do this? **

    - Make Internet access available to all residents at affordable prices.
    - Avoid the issues that arise with loss of Net Neutrality 
    - Have a redundant network for emergency use
    - Foster tech businesses in Pasadena
    - Corporate providers monopolize the industry setting prices
    - Corporate providers collect information about you and [sell it to 3rd parties](http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2017/03/28/congress_votes_to_allow_broadband_providers_to_sell_your_data.html)
